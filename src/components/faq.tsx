    question: "Do I need to buy any hardware or sensors?",
    answer:
      "No. SteadyArc uses only the camera already on your computer, tablet, or smartphone. No wearables, no VR headset, no specialized equipment.",
  },
  {
    question: "What clinical metrics does it capture?",
    answer:
      "Reaction time, eye-hand latency, movement accuracy, coordination score, completion time, error rate, and longitudinal trends. Enough for clinicians to assess whether a patient is improving, stable, or deteriorating.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is it for clinics or for home use?",
    answer:
      "Both. Patients play a short game at home while clinicians monitor recovery trends from their dashboard. It extends care beyond the clinic without adding workload.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who pays for SteadyArc?",
    answer:
      "Hospitals, rehabilitation centers, and clinics subscribe. Patients are users, not payers. Future phases may include value-based contracts with insurers.",
  },
  {
    question: "What conditions does it support?",
    answer:
      "Initially, post-stroke motor rehabilitation. The same model can extend to Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and other conditions with neurological motor deficits.",
  },
